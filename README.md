# Daita's portfolio
This is my rough portfolio. I am trying out git, github and vscode for the first time so getting my hands dirty. I am learning with Tanay Pratap as a part of level 0.

Till now I know the basics of:
1. JavaScript
1. NodeJS
1. How git and github works
1. CHALK
1. Created a CLI app

Looking to learn more as days passed by.
