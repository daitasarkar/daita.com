            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Calcutta University. I have been a programmer
                since my high school days. I am learning how to make web applications in the recent times and here I want to 
                show some of my projects. I am looking forward to learn more , gain exposure and become a better problem 
                solver.

            <h1>Technologies</h1>
            <p>I am familiar with <strong>HTML5</strong>,<strong>CSS</strong>,<strong>Javascript</strong>,<strong>NodeJS</strong>,
                <strong>ReactJS</strong> and <strong>web hosting</strong>. I am also aware about how 
                <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> works and how I can showcase my work over there and work together with fellow 
                programmers. I know how to create responsive web applications and style them in the most user friendly way
                possible. I also know how to work with APIs. </p>
            <p>Being aware of the user needs and their requirements is always a add-on or rather I must say is the most
                important part of any web application creation. I am glad to share with you that I have proper knowledge 
                of <strong>UX</strong> and <strong>UI</strong> and have been practising <strong>user research</strong> 
                and <strong>UI designing</strong> for quite a while. I know my way around with softwares like <strong>Figma</strong>.

            <h1>My favorites</h1>
            <p> I am an avid reader of both fictional and non-fictional books. I believe that it is through 
                reading books that you learn the most. <strong>John Green</strong> is my favorite author because he can give life
                to his stories and characters. Once you have read his books, there is no going back. It becomes
                an integral part of life and ofcourse it teaches you that <strong>"You can have the best life within the 
                    numbered days"</strong>. I am also an Indian classical dancer. I love to swim. You can find me interacting with 
                people from all walks of life during most of my free time. I think that interacting with people is the 
                best way to learn and grow and be aware of whatever is going around in the world.
