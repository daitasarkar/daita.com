    Hii ! I am <b>Daita Sarkar</b>. 
    <p>I am final year student of Asutosh College, affiliated to Calcutta University. I am pursuing my bachelor's of science in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>I have created some CLI apps which I am going to showcase here. </p>

    <p>I am a avid reader of books. I think that it is through literature only that you would be able to experience and explore the world. It is a gateway to larger universe. My favorite book is <b>The Fault In Our Stars</b>by <b>John Green</b>. It helps us to understand that it is actually possible to live a lifetime in just a few numbered days. It also helps me in realising that <i>the world is not a wish-granting factory</i></p>

    <p>I also love to watch movies.<b>Forrest Gump</b>is my favorite movie of all times. It is by watching this movie that one realises that honesty and innocence are priceless possessions and once lost can never be retrieved back.</p>
